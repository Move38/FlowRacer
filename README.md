| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 6                | 1                 |  1 - 5 minutes       | 6 & Up           |

## Objective
Keep your flow racer alive by always having open road ahead.

## Setup
Add Blinks to each other adding to a single end of the chain. Press the first Blink in the chain and see the flow start towards the end. Attach Blinks that no longer have the flow to the red dot at the end of the line. 

## Gameplay
Keep ahead of the flow by placing Blinks at the next location (indicated by a read dot). The road will twist and turn and hopefully you won't run out of road. Grab Blinks quickly once the flow has left them.

To reset, simply pull all of the Blinks apart.
